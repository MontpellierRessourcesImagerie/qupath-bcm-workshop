These descriptions sound very arbitrary and depend on who is talking. So far, we simply made a visual assessment of the quality of our segmentation, but we didn't quantify how good or bad it is. If we needed to rank all the classifiers that we made to know who has the most precise one, we would need numeric values describing the output of our classifiers.\n",
