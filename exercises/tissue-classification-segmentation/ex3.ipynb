    "- The goal of this exercise is to [process the compactness](#What-is-compactness) of the lung tissue on each image.\n",
    "- To do so, you will need to:\n",
    "    - Find the polygon corresponding to the whole lung tissue and give it the `Lung` classification.\n",
    "    - Use the workflow recorder to apply the classifier and find the lung tissue on all your images.\n",
    "    - Use the script to convert a set of polygons into a convex hull, and give the `Hull` classification to this new polygon.\n",
