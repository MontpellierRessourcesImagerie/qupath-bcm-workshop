    "- The goal of this exercise is to measure the area of epithelium in images of colorectal cancers.\n",
    "- To do so, you will need to:\n",
    "    - Find the polygon corresponding to the whole tissue and give it the `Colon` classification using a thresholder.\n",
    "    - Make a training image from a set of representative chunks of image.\n",
    "    - Train a pixel classifier able to differentiate the epithelium from the rest of the tissue.\n",
    "    - Apply the pixel classifier to find epithelium detections within the colon annotations.\n",
