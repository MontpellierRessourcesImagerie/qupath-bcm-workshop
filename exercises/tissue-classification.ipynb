    "These exercises aim to use different ways to locate some areas into some objects, or the objects themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Find the objects on a slide\n",
    "- Find the area of necrosis\n",
    "- Find the area of positivity to a dye\n",

    "Depending on our problem, we will want to produce either a new set of polygons corresponding to our areas of interest or a measure in µm² within the properties of a polygon.\n",
