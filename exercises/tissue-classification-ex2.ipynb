    "\n",
    "- The goal of this exercise is to [process the compactness](####what-is-compactness) of the lung tissue on each image.\n",
    "- To do so, you will need to:\n",
    "    - Find the polygon corresponding to the whole lung tissue and give it the `Lung` classification.\n",
    "    - Use the workflow recorder to apply the classifier to all your images.\n",
    "    - Use the script to convert a set of polygons into a convex hull, and give the `Hull` classification to this new polygon.\n",
    "    - Export the measurements to a TSV so you can process the compactness per image in a spread sheet software.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Before starting this step, make sure that you have the `Lung` class available in your class list.\n",
    "- In the top-bar menu, go to \"Classify\" > \"Pixel classification\" > \"Create thresholder...\"\n",
    "- You must now set the correct settings foryour thresholder:\n",
    "    - **Resolution**: We will need the preview to choose the correct resolution, so just set it to \"Moderate\" as a starting point\n",
    "    - **Channel**: We want the whole object (not only the nuclei or only the DAB areas) so we want to use as much signal as we possibly have. We are looking at a transmission image which means that we see white light as it passes through our object. Where there is nothing, we should observe solid white (or a very clear color). Where the object is, the intensity of a channel (R, G or B) is necessarily lower than the background. So we will choose \"Min channels\" that simply takes the minimum of R, G and B for every pixel.\n",
    "    - **Prefilter**: If you take a closer look at the image, you will notice small gaps between nuclei. You will also notice that all nuclei don't necessarily have the same intensity. To smooth everything and get a mask without holes, we will try to use a Gaussian blur as prefilter.\n",
    "    - **Smoothing sigma**: This applies to the prefilter. If you leave this parameter to 0, the prefilter won't be applied. You can start with a radius of 1, and we will adjust it when we will have a preview.\n",
    "    - **Threshold**: Values in your images for from 0 to 255, so you start at 128 and we will adjust it when you will have a preview.\n",
    "    - **Above threshold**: It is the class that will be given to the pixels above the threshold. As we said before, high values correspond to the background when you work of transmission images. So we will set to `Ignore*`.\n",
    "    - **Below threshold**: We are working on lungs biopsies, so we will set that parameter to `Lung`.\n",
    "- From the moment you provided an above and a below class, you should have a live preview on your image.\n",
    "- If you don't see anything, make sure that the ![QP preview button](../media/qp-icons/show-preview.png) preview is not deactivated, or that the slider right beside it is not at its minimum.\n",
    "- What you can change:\n",
    "    - If you estimate that the mask you see is too \"blocky\" (pixels too big), you can pass your resolution to \"High\" for example.\n",
    "    - If the mask is missing too many pixels, increase your threshold\n",
    "    - If playing with the threshold results in too much noise being caught in the mask, you can increase the sigma of your Gaussian blur.\n",
    "- Once you are happy with what you see, give your classifier a name (\"find-lung\" for example), press \"Save\" and close the \"Create thresholder\" window."
