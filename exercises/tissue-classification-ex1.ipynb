    "#### Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal of this exercise is to process the glomerulus-to-kidney ratio for every image you have.\n",
    "- To do so, you will need to:\n",
    "    - Find the polygon corresponding to the whole kidney and give it the `Kidney` classification.\n",
    "    - Find the set of polygons representing glomerulus and give them the `Glomerulus` classification.\n",
    "    - Repeat that on two or three images.\n",
    "    - Export the measurements to a TSV so you can process the ratio per image in a spread sheet.\n",
    "- After that, we will switch to some lungs images to have a more accurate idea of the limitations that you will encounter if you stick to fully manual segmentation.\n",

    "- On these images, kidneys are solid circular blocks with no to little holes (so we will ignore them).\n",

Don't forget that the scale of your wand depends on your zoom level. If you want to select the whole object, stay far!\n",
