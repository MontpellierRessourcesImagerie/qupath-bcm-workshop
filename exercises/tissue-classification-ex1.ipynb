    "The most basic way to locate your objects is to create the polygons by yourself...\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may expect, this approach is time-consuming, user dependend and becomes nearly impossible depending on what you need to find.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal of this exercise is to process the glomerulus-to-kidney ratio for all images.\n",
    "- To do so, you will need to:\n",
    "    - Find the polygon corresponding to the whole kidney and give it the `Kidney` classification.\n",
    "    - Find the set of polygons representing glomerulus and give them the `Glomerulus` classification.\n",
    "    - Repeat these steps on two or three images.\n",
    "    - Export the measurements to a TSV so you can process the ratio per image in a spread sheet software.\n",
    "- After that, we will switch to some lungs images. They will demonstrate a case where manual segmentation has too many limitations to produce a usable result.\n",
